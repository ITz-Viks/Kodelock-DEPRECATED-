# Kodelock
a tool to assist in code raiding in rust

This tool is designed to be used on a second monitor.

This tools will allow you to see a easily readable code to put in when code raiding and it allows you to go forwards and backwards without left and right arrows so you don't have to quench your eyes to see the code you were at in that .txt file and you don't even need to tab out!
It has a feature to "start from" whichever line you wish to, so if there is multiple people using this tool at once it is possible to coordinate who will be using codes from what line eg. 1st person from 0-300 2nd from 300-600 and so on.

To launch this tool you will need python3 and you will need to install 2 libraries for it.

How to install:

1) Download python3 and install it: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.0/python-3.10.0-amd64.exe
2) Continue the install on default settings unless you personally wish to change something.
3) When installed search python in your search bar and open a python command promp to check if it's install properly.
4) After that search up cmd and open it. In it you will write: pip install pillow pynput 
5) When you're done installing(It should only take about 5sec) open the Launch.bat file and explore.

Alternativley you could open command prompt cd into the directory of Kodelock and launch it directly with  python Kodelock.py
